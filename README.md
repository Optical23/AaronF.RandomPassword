# Password Generator 
My approach to this challenge was to break down everything I needed from the user and then make it build the password smoothly.
I started with the arrays of the accetable criteria 
Then in the function made in the starter code I ask the user for all the information I will need
The user is asked to try again if they imput impossible criteria
Then the return calls a function to use the criteria to build the passcode
It builds an array of acceptable criteria and uses that to randomly generate a passcode with the correct length
